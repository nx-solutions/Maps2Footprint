# Maps2Footprint
[Google Play - com.nxsolutions.maps2footprint](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxsolutions.maps2footprint):

This program can help you to add Footprints to HTC Locations. You can either enter GPS coordinates and location information manually or export it from Google Maps using the share button.

I've written this application some years ago now when I needed it for travelling around in Taiwan. I have no use for it anymore personally, but I'm still leaving it out there in case there are other people who have a use for it.

As I'm not using it myself anymore I won't notice if there are any issues with the Google interface. If you use this application and detect any problems don't hesitate to contact me and I'll make sure the problem gets fixed for you.
