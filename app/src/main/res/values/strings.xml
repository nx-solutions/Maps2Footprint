    Fill out the GPS location and info fields and press \"Export\" to export the info to a file 
    called Maps2Footprint.kml.\n
    \n
    By selecting \"Share this place\" in Google Maps and clicking Maps2Footprint in the menu 
    list will fill out the GPS and info fields.\n
    \n    
    This file can be imported into HTC Locations by selecting \"Import\" from the Footprints menu.\n
    \n
    After importing the \"Footprint\" it can be found in \"All footprints\" to be edited or used for
    navigation.\n
    \n
    \n
    The highest accuracy is achieved when selecting an \"address\" and not a \"place\". This 
    has to dowith the way that Google Maps passes on the information. Selecting a \"place\" does
    give the advantage that the name and phone number fields are automatically filled out.\n
    \n
    If you\'ve got any problems with the application not being able to parse certain locations,
    then please \"Share this place\" through e-mail and send the info to 
    maps2footprint&#064;nx-solutions.com
